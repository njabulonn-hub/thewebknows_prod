NOTE: Binary Image Files Needed

The following binary image files need to be created separately:

1. favicon.ico
   - Convert favicon.svg to ICO format
   - Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48
   - Can use online tools like: https://convertio.co/svg-ico/ or https://favicon.io/

2. og-image.png
   - Open Graph image for social media sharing
   - Recommended size: 1200x630 pixels
   - Should include site name "The Web Knows" and tagline
   - Can be created from the favicon.svg design or a custom design

Both files are referenced in the HTML but the site will work without them (browsers will just show default icons).
